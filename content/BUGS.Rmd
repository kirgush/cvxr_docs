## Issues with `CVXR` 1.0

- The following error occurs in line 103 of `integer-programming.Rmd`.
```
Error in cvxCanon$build_matrix(lin_vec, id_to_col_C) : std::bad_alloc
```
- Pliable lasso complains in lines 236-237:
```
Error in cvxCanon$build_matrix(lin_vec, id_to_col_C) : 
  allocator<T>::allocate(size_t n) 'n' exceeds maximum supported size
```
Usually indicates something is not setting its size properly like
	`sum_entries` did in another problem.
- Kelly gambling gives slightly different, but not overtly wrong results. Why?  
- Sparse Inverse Covariance Estimation definitely gives wrong results!

## Resolved Issues

- Near Isotonic and Near Convex complains about `inverse_data` not
  being available.
- Unpack routine needs to be written.  This affects
  `solver-peculiarities.Rmd`, `speed.Rmd`
